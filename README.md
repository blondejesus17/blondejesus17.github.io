## Argghhhh!!!!
PIRATEBAY IS FILLED WITH MALWARE, This is how 2 get free shit and not get a virus
### Prerequisites
- ***GOOD* ADBLOCK** (NOT ADBLOCK PLUS)
	- **Best**: [uBlock Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) + [AdGuard Extra](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/adguard-extra/gkeojjjcdcopjkbelgbcpckplegclfeg?hl=en) (on Brave Browser)[^1]
	- **Works**: [uBlock Origin Lite](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh?hl=en) (on Chrome)[^2]
	- *Note*: *Some ad popups can get thru adblockers so everytime u click a button make sure **it only opens one page** and **it is the correct page***
- **VPN** 
	- **Best**: [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) (free/slow version or $10/mo for speed)
- **[qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)** - Only torrent app you should trust.
	- uTorrent, for example, is full of spam ads and mines crypto. Delete it
	- Always use VPN when torrenting
- **Translator** in ur browser or an extension
	- *Dont fear spooky languages*, many of the best most trustworthy sites are Russian etc

[^1]: Brave is based on Chrome but u dont sell ur soul to google. Highly recommend but disable the ai/crypto bloat
[^2]: uBlock slightly neutered on Chrome cuz google hates adblockers now
### BEST OF THE BEST (in this order IMO)
- **FMHY** - [fmhy.net](https://fmhy.net), [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/)
	- The most comprehensive guide to free media (both pirated and free) that exists. It's SO fucking good. But there is so much, so here are my favs:
- **Adobe Programs:** [monkrus](https://w16.monkrus.ws/) - literally the lebron james of adobe piracy
- **Gaming**:
	- [FitGirl](https://fitgirl-repacks.site/) (extremely trusted; repacks games into smaller sizes w/ same quality)
	- [cs.rin.ru](https://cs.rin.ru/forum) (signup & learning curve but they r the White House of game piracy)
	- [GOG Games](https://gog-games.to/)
	- Much more detail here https://ripped.guide/PC-Software/Games/
- **Plugins for FL, Adobe, Davinci**:
	- [Team VR](https://codec.kyiv.ua/releases.htm) (legendary cracking group; one of the few that releases directly to public and not via intermediary sites)
		- If u cant find something check general sites below, soft98 and rutracker are great as well
- **General**:
	- [soft98.ir](https://soft98.ir) (direct downloads; software galore; requires AdGuard Extra for stubborn anti-adblock)
	- [rutracker.org](https://rutracker.org) (torrents; requires signup but just use temp email; awesome for software and especially audio)
	- [cracksurl](https://cracksurl.com)
	- [dirtywarez](https://forum.dirtywarez.com)
- **Streaming**:
	- [Blackbeard Media](https://discord.gg/hKbRrkuMHh) (discord) + Emby
		- Emby is just a media player, Blackbeard is the service. Cheap subscription to get basically every movie or show from every streaming service in one place, no ads *with a TV app*, website, mobile app, for an actual netflix-like piracy experience and not just some shitty website
	- [streamed.su](https://streamed.su) (sports)
	- [DAB Music](https://dab.yeet.su) (*lossless/HQ* music download database & web player)
- **Other Useful Tools**:
	- [cobalt.tools](https://cobalt.tools) (THE BEST youtube/multiplatform downloader)
	- [Bypass Paywalls Clean](https://gitflic.ru/project/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean) extension 
		- Works super well but harder to install since not allowed on chrome store.
### FAQs & WTFS?!?!??
- Windows Defender blocked this / virustotal detected that. Am I safe?
	- *Probably* a false positive (you're downloading programs that have been hacked), but don't count on it. 
	- Signs it's OK:
		- Highly trusted source (IMO: monkrus, FitGirl, Team VR, soft98)
			- *rutracker is 99% great and they verify their uploads. But rarely I've seen something sus slip thru the cracks, so I wouldn't give them an automatic pass like the ones I've just listed*
		- Detection reason is "keygen" "cracktool" etc. Like yeah fucking duh that's what you want. Also "PUP / Potentially Unwanted" or AI Heuristic detections
		- <10 or so detections on virustotal and detections are from irrelevant dipshit antiviruses. 
		- Googling the detection reason shows many people complaining about false positives
	- Signs it might be BAD:
		- Half the list on virustotal is red, not just a minority. Extra penalty if really good AVs like Malwarebytes or Kaspersky detect it
		- Googling the uploader of your download & what you downloaded and seeing similar skepticism on Reddit. Sometimes good websites can turn bad or simply make a mistake when sourcing
- XYZ SITE BLOCKS VPN HELPP
	- Solution: fuck that site
	- If u down bad: use [MysteriumDark VPN](https://www.mysteriumdark.com/) **residential** servers
