PIRATEBAY IS FILLED WITH MALWARE, This is how 2 get free shit and not get a virus
### Prerequisites
- ***GOOD* ADBLOCK** (NOT ADBLOCK PLUS)
	- *Best*: uBlock Origin + AdGuard Extra (on Brave Browser)[^1]
	- *Acceptable*: uBlock Origin Lite (on Chrome)[^2]
	- *Note*: *Some ad popups can get thru adblockers so everytime u click a button make sure **it only opens one page** and **it is the correct page***
- **VPN** 
	- *Best*: ProtonVPN (free/slow version or $10/mo for speed)
- **qBittorrent** - Only torrent app you should trust.
	- uTorrent, for example, is full of spam ads and mines crypto. Delete it
	- Always use VPN when torrenting
- **Translator** in ur browser or an extension
	- *Dont fear spooky languages*, many of the best most trustworthy sites are Russian etc

[^1]: Brave is based on Chrome but u dont sell ur soul to google. Highly recommend but disable the ai/crypto bloat
[^2]: uBlock slightly neutered on Chrome cuz google hates adblockers now
### BEST OF THE BEST (in this order IMO)
- **FMHY** - [fmhy.net](https://fmhy.net), subreddit
	- The most comprehensive guide to free media (both pirated and free) that exists. It's SO fucking good. But there is so much, so here are my favs:
- **Adobe Programs:** monkrus - literally the lebron james of adobe piracy
- **Gaming**:
	- FitGirl (extremely trusted; repacks games into smaller sizes w/ same quality)
	- Dodi (another trusted repacker)
	- cs.rin.ru (signup & learning curve but they r the White House of game piracy)
	- GOG Games
	- Much more detail here https://ripped.guide/PC-Software/Games/
- **Plugins for FL, Adobe, Davinci**:
	- Team VR (legendary cracking group; one of the few that releases directly to public and not via intermediary sites)
		- If u cant find something check general sites below, soft98 and rutracker are great as well
- **General**:
	- soft98.ir (direct downloads; software galore; requires AdGuard Extra for stubborn anti-adblock)
	- rutracker.org (torrents; requires signup but just use temp email; awesome for software and especially audio)
	- cracksurl
	- dirtywarez
- **Streaming**:
	- Blackbeard Media (discord) + Emby
		- Emby is just a media player, Blackbeard is the service. Cheap subscription to get basically every movie or show from every streaming service in one place, no ads *with a TV app*, website, mobile app, for an actual netflix-like piracy experience and not just some shitty website
	- streamed.su (sports)
	- DAB Music (*lossless/HQ* music download database & web player)
- **Other Useful Tools**:
	- [cobalt.tools](https://cobalt.tools) (THE BEST youtube/multiplatform downloader)
	- [Bypass Paywalls Clean](https://gitflic.ru/project/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean) extension 
		- Works super well but harder to install since not allowed on chrome store.

### FAQs & WTFS?!?!??
- Windows Defender blocked this / virustotal detected that. Am I safe?
	- *Probably* a false positive (you're downloading programs that have been hacked), but don't count on it. 
	- Signs it's OK:
		- Highly trusted source (IMO: monkrus, FitGirl, Team VR, soft98)
			- *rutracker is 99% great and they verify their uploads. But rarely I've seen something sus slip thru the cracks, so I wouldn't give them an automatic pass like the ones I've just listed*
		- Detection reason is "keygen" "cracktool" etc. Like yeah fucking duh that's what you want. Also "PUP / Potentially Unwanted" or AI Heuristic detections
		- <10 or so detections on virustotal and detections are from irrelevant dipshit antiviruses. 
		- Googling the detection reason shows many people complaining about false positives
	- Signs it might be BAD:
		- Half the list on virustotal is red, not just a minority. Extra penalty if really good AVs like Malwarebytes or Kaspersky detect it
		- Googling the uploader of your download & what you downloaded and seeing similar skepticism on Reddit. Sometimes good websites can turn bad or simply make a mistake when sourcing
- XYZ SITE BLOCKS VPN HELPP
	- Solution: fuck that site
	- If u down bad: use MysteriumDark VPN **residential** servers
